🧠 Ipro NeuroGuide
📌 What the Project Does
Ipro NeuroGuide is an offline-capable, web-based mental health tool designed for clinicians and trainees. It integrates standardized assessments—PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (anxiety), and PCL-5 (PTSD)—with session logging, longitudinal symptom tracking, and automated treatment guidance. The app is fully functional within a browser, requiring no server or internet connection.
💡 Why the Project Is Useful
Accurate diagnosis in mental health care is often complicated by overlapping symptoms across disorders. Ipro NeuroGuide helps reduce diagnostic error by:
•	Structuring and auto-scoring validated psychological assessments
•	Tracking changes in symptom severity over time using visual charts
•	Offering evidence-informed treatment suggestions based on score thresholds
•	Operating entirely offline for use in clinics, outreach programs, or resource-limited settings
This tool empowers mental health practitioners to make informed decisions efficiently while maintaining client privacy and continuity of care.
